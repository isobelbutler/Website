                        My name’s Isobel (she/her). 
                        For the past 4 years I’ve 
                        worked in the Art Department in TV.   
                        I left the industry 
                        this year after a final series on <i>MasterChef</i> as Assistant 
                        Art Director, and have since been building my application for <i>Founders and Coders</i> whilst 
                        working in a plant shop. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Weirdly enough, the TV industry was what rebooted my interested in coding. 
                        I interviewed with a company who were looking for a Runner. 
                        I’d always been tech savvy and as a teen I loved picking 
                        apart existing blog themes and making them my own. When 
                        I didn’t get the job because they wanted someone with more 
                        explicit tech skills, it motivated me to revisit those skills 
                        and create something I could showcase. I taught myself HTML 
                        and CSS and built myself a <a href="https://isobelbutler.co.uk" target="_blank"><i>website</i></a> from scratch.

                        I believe that language holds a lot of power. It’s at the core of human connection
                        and through the smallest change in syntax you can completely alter meaning - I think 
                        this is beautiful. I studied English Language and Literature at the University 
                        of Leeds and believe that meaning is conveyed best through clear, concise language.

                        I’ve always loved visual design - whether playing with fonts and 
                        colours or redecorating a room. 
                        When I worked in TV I loved transforming a filming space
                        as a team and then stepping back after 
                        to admire all our hark work. I also love setting myself 
                        DIY projects. Most recently I built hanging herb planters out of 
                        old wooden pallets found on East Street Market which I’m going 
                        to grow shady herbs in.

                        and am a regular gym-goer, it allows me to be kindly competitive 
                        with myself. This year I want to cycle the Coast to Coast and

                <p>
                    I’ve always loved maths, logic, design, and language and for me, 
                    coding is at the intersect of all these pleasures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love the challenge of trying to figure out clean ways to make things more 
                    efficient. I’ve always been interested in computers and tech, I used to spend 
                    hours altering blog themes and have always been the go-to person to ask techie 
                    problems to at work and with my mates. When I left the TV Art Department I was 
                    keen to start working on building some websites. When I did this I realised 
                    that whilst I love visual design, the thing that brings me the most joy is the 
                    behind the scenes - of finding elegant ways to make everything work and coming up 
                    with neat solutions to the problems that occur along the way. There have been moments
                    whilst building the application projects where I’ve literally cheered when I’ve 
                    finally gotten something to work.

                    <p>
                        The tech industry is famously homogenous in terms of it’s workforce 
                        and whilst companies are beginning to prioritise hiring more women, 
                        a lot of the time it can feel like performative inclusivity. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        Entering the industry felt impenetrable both socially and monetarily until I 
                        heard about Founders and Coders from a previous cohort member. 
                        I’m a queer, neurodivergent woman and to have a learning environment which 
                        feels like it recognises and accepts people like me feels 
                        extremely special. It would be an honour to be a part of 
                        Founders and Coders.
