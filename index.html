                            My name’s Isobel (she/her). 
                            For the past 4 years I’ve 
                            worked in the Art Department in TV.   
                            I left the industry 
                            this year after a final series on <i>MasterChef</i> as Assistant 
                            Art Director, and have since been building my application for <i>Founders and Coders</i> whilst 
                            working in a plant shop. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Weirdly enough, the TV industry was what rebooted my interested in coding. 
                            I interviewed with a company who were looking for a Runner. 
                            I’d always been tech savvy and as a teen I loved picking 
                            apart existing blog themes and making them my own. When 
                            I didn’t get the job because they wanted someone with more 
                            explicit tech skills, it motivated me to revisit those skills 
                            and create something I could showcase. I taught myself HTML 
                            and CSS and built myself a <a href="https://isobelbutler.co.uk" target="_blank"><i>website</i></a> from scratch.

                    I’ve always loved maths, logic, design, and language and for me, 
                    coding is at the intersect of all these pleasures.

                        <span class="bluetext">Why Founders and Coders.</span> It feels sacred 
                        to have a path into a classically <span class="line-through">exclusive</span> industry with people 
                        who actively prioritise diversity.</span> 
                    </h2>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            The tech industry is famously homogenous in terms of it’s workforce 
                            and whilst companies are beginning to prioritise hiring more women, 
                            a lot of the time it can feel like performative inclusivity. 
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            Entering the industry felt impenetrable both socially and monetarily until I 
                            heard about Founders and Coders from a previous cohort member. 
                            I’m a queer, neurodivergent woman and to have a learning environment which 
                            feels like it recognises and accepts people like me feels 
                            extremely special. It would be an honour to be a part of 
                            Founders and Coders.
