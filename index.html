                            My name’s Isobel (she/her).

                            For the past four years I’ve 
                            worked in the Art Department in TV.   
                            I left the industry 
                            this year after a final series on MasterChef as Assistant 
                            Art Director, and have since been building my application for Founders and Coders whilst 
                            working in a plant shop. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Weirdly enough, the TV industry was what rebooted my interested in coding. 
                        </p><p>    
                            I interviewed with a company who were looking for a Runner. 
                            I’d always been tech savvy and as a teen I loved picking 
                            apart existing blog themes and making them my own. When 
                            I didn’t get the job because they wanted someone with more 
                            explicit tech skills, it motivated me to revisit those skills 
                            and create something I could showcase. I taught myself HTML 
                            and CSS and built myself a <a href="https://isobelbutler.co.uk" target="_blank"><i>website</i></a> from scratch.

                                For the past four years I’ve worked in the Art Department in TV 
                                doing lots of painting, fixing, planning, and making. I left the 
                                industry in March after a final series on MasterChef as Assistant 
                                Art Director, and have since been working in a plant shop whilst 
                                teaching myself to code.

                                My core values are that other people are what make life wonderful, 
                                that you grow through challenging yourself whilst listening to 
                                your boundaries, and that perseverance will get you a long way.

                                I find balance and joy through exercise - I cycle, jump rope, 
                                and am a regular gym-goer, it allows me to be kindly competitive 
                                with myself. This year I want to cycle the Coast to Coast and 
                                experiment with track cycling.

                        <span class="bluetext">Why Founders and Coders.</span> It feels sacred 
                        to have a path into a classically exclusive industry with people 
                        who actively prioritise diversity.

                        <p>
                            The tech industry is famously homogenous in terms of it’s workforce 
                            and whilst companies are beginning to prioritise hiring more women, 
                            a lot of the time it can feel like performative inclusivity. 
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            Entering the industry felt impenetrable monetarily until I 
                            heard about Founders and Coders from a previous cohort member. 
                            I’m a queer woman and to have a learning environment which 
                            feels like it recognises and accepts people like me feels 
                            extremely special. It would be an honour to be a part of 
                            Founders and Coders.
