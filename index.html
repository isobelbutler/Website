                        <span class="bluetext">Who I am.</span> I’m a 26 year old coder-in-the-making 
                        living in South East London.
                    </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                        For the past four years I’ve worked in the Art Department in TV 
                        doing lots of painting, fixing, planning, and making. I left the 
                        industry in March after a final series on MasterChef as Assistant 
                        Art Director, and have since been working in a plant shop whilst 
                        teaching myself to code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My core values are that other people are what make life wonderful, 
                        that you grow through challenging yourself whilst listening to 
                        your boundaries, and that perseverance will get you a long way.
                    </p> 
                    <p>   
                        I find balance and joy through exercise - I cycle, jump rope, 
                        and am a regular gym-goer, it allows me to be kindly competitive 
                        with myself. This year I want to cycle the Coast to Coast and 
                        experiment with track cycling.

                    I’ve always loved maths, logic, design, and language and for me, 
                    coding is at the intersect of all these pleasures.
